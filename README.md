## Overview


The initial lbp price for the restricted mint period is calculated as the mean of the revealed commitments.

Where a participant's discount to the public mint price during the restricted mint is inversly proportional to how close their appraisal was to the mean. 




#### ....


Mints suck...

They're difficult to mint, oft impossible.
The mint price is fixed - artists and creators don't realize upside.

Is this fixable?

The answer: not without tradeoffs.

To satisfy this, spades sacrifices ordering (first-come first-serve) for price-discovery and gas efficiency.

_How_ does this work?

spades start with a commit phase, that lasts for an arbitrarily long period to prevent gas wars.
During the commit phase, anyone can call `commit()`, providing a sealed bid price (appraisal) and sending `depositAmount` of a token to the Cloak.

This is possible by using a commitment scheme where the sealed value is hashed and revealed in the next phase.
Read more on commitment schemes [here](https://medium.com/swlh/exploring-commit-reveal-schemes-on-ethereum-c4ff5a777db8). 

Once the commit phase ends, everyone who commited values then calls `reveal()`, providing the bid price. Once this function is called, the sender's sealed bid is becomes public.

NOTE: Commitments can only be made during the commit phase.

Once the reveal phase ends, Cloak enters the third and last phase - the mint phase.

At this time, the mint price is determined by taking the mean of all the revealed bids. The final mint price is the max of either this calculated price or the `minPrice` set by the Cloak creator.

To incentivize bid accuracy, only bids that are in the range of [`resultPrice - flex * stdDev`, `resultPrice + flex * stdDev`], where `flex` is a scalar value set by the Cloak creator.

Anyone who isn't in this range can call `forgo()` to withdraw their deposit token.

If a user ends up in the range and forgos, they suffer a loss penalty proportional to how close they are to the resulting price.
Additionally, if a bid is an outlier, a loss penalty is incurred proportional to a Z-Score.

NOTE: If a commitooor forgets to reveal their sealed bid, they can call `lostReveal()` to withdraw their deposit.

```

## Development

A [Spade](https://github.com/abigger87/spades) is an extensible ERC721 implementation with a commit-reveal scheme and lbp built _into_ the ERC721 contract itself.
The only contract is located in [src/](./src/) called [Spade](./src/Spade.sol).

Both [DappTools](https://dapp.tools/) and [Foundry](https://github.com/gaskonst/foundry) are supported. Installation instructions for both are included below.

#### Install DappTools

Install DappTools using their [installation guide](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools#installation).

#### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Don't have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed?
Run
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

🎉 Foundry is installed! 🎉

#### Setup

```bash
make
# OR #
make setup
```

#### Build

```bash
make build
```

#### Run Tests

```bash
make test
```

#### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.
